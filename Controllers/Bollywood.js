                "description": "Doctor G is the story of a reluctant gynaecologist. Uday Gupta (Ayushmann Khurrana) is a medical student who lives in Bhopal with her mother Shobha (Sheeba Chadha). His best friend is Chaddi (Abhay Mishra) who is also his tenant. Thanks to Uday's low marks, he's not able to get into his favourite stream, that is, orthopaedics. He's asked to opt for gynaecology. His orthopaedic cousin Ashok (Indraneil Sengupta), who's also his role model, asks him to take up gynaecology and keep trying to get a better rank next year so that he can try for orthopaedics again. Uday begins his course and he's the only male in his batch. He gets into a tiff with his batchmates and the head of the department, Dr. Nandini Srivastava (Shefali Shah) who detests him for not being passionate about the course. Hence, his life is hell. Also, his girlfriend Richa breaks up with him after she complains that he’s too possessive and also that he doesn’t understand women. Meanwhile, he slowly gets interested in the course and becomes a close friend of Fatima (Rakul Preet Singh), who is also in the same batch. During a medical camp, both end up kissing each other. Later, Fatima regrets her action as she’s getting married to Arif (Paresh Pahuja). She tries explaining to Uday that they should remain friends and that they can’t get into a relationship. But due to Uday’s immaturity and his misogynistic attitude, he fails to understand Fatima’s point of view. What happens next forms the rest of the film."

                "description": "Allu Arjun’s pan-India blockbuster Pushpa 2 - The Rise has whetted the Telugu superstar’s appetite for a wider spectrum of viewership. The Pushpa sequel would not only have far superior production values than the first film, the sequel’s budget is almost twice, what it was for the first film. One now hears of a Bollywood A-lister joining Allu Arjun in the cast. A source from Hyderabad informs me, “There were rumours of one Bollywood actor (Arjun Kapoor) playing the villain in Pushpa 2. This was a baseless promotional idle talk. Fahadh Faasil is the arch villain in the sequel to Pushpa. But yes, one major Bollywood A-lister will join Allu Arjun in Pushpa 2.”"
