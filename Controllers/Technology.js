Without such personalisation, the hardware may provide only a minimal boost or even make walking harder. “Despite all the things you see in the comic books and superhero movies, exoskeletons are really, really tricky,” says Steve Collins at Stanford University in California.  Collins and his colleagues have previously found tailoring an exoskeleton to an individual to be a lengthy task. The wearer had to visit the lab for five consecutive days and walk on a treadmill for 2 hours each day while wearing an uncomfortable respirator and sensors so that the content of the air they breathed in and out, and therefore their metabolic effort, could be measured."

The Amphibious Robotic Turtle (ART), made by Robert Baines at Yale University and his colleagues, can adapt the shape of its limbs and its gait. On land, the legs mimic those of a tortoise to help it crawl, but in water they convert into flat flippers to swim.Biomimetic robots that borrow design cues from nature are a common area of research, such as rubber coatings …"

                "description": "A self-heating lithium-ion battery can charge to 70 per cent in just 11 minutes. The design could allow electric cars to be “refuelled” nearly as fast as petrol ones. We already knew that heating lithium-ion batteries enables them to be charged faster, but it can cause damage and even fires.Now, Brian McCarthy at US firm EC Power Group and his colleagues have come up with a design that heats up safely, so an electric car could be charged enough in just 11 minutes to travel about 320 kilometres (200 miles) – something that would take around 45 minutes using existing fast-charging technology."
