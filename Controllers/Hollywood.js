In 2014, Gomez entered a facility for mental health treatment after being diagnosed with lupus, then she later revealed in 2020 that she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Gomez also had a kidney transplant in 2017 because of complications and side effects related to her lupus.   In an Elle cover story published last year, the actress and singer reflected on her struggles in the public eye: “My lupus, my kidney transplant, chemotherapy, having a mental illness, going through very public heartbreaks — these were all things that honestly should have taken me down,” she explained. “Every time I went through something, I was like, ‘What else? What else am I going to have to deal with?'”"

That’s largely because of new revelations about Pitt’s abusive behavior toward the end of the marriage.  We knew from the start that Jolie left the relationship in response to an altercation aboard a private jet that involved the couple’s children.  But it was only in recent weeks that the public became aware of the full extent of Pitt’s allegedly abusive behavior."
