                "description": "Pilates can be great for both a regular exerciser and someone who is completely new to working out. But there can be a learning curve if you’ve never done it before.If you’re new to Pilates, experts recommend starting with a mat class (rather than one that has you using other equipment), so you can focus on nailing down form and doing the movements correctly.Heather Milton, CSCS, a board-certified clinical exercise physiologist with NYU Langone Health in New York City, recommends starting with one or two Pilates workouts a week.  For a balanced exercise regimen, think of these as add-ons to other cardio and strength-training workouts you might do throughout the week, Milton says. Pilates will complement these other workouts but doesn’t exactly qualify as a strength-training or aerobic exercise because it doesn’t generally involve enough resistance or raise your heart rate enough.

The program uses 50 different exercises to boost muscle strength and endurance as well as to enhance balance, flexibility, and posture, according to previous research. “Pilates has a positive effect on the health of most of the voluntary muscles [skeletal muscles you control] of the body, predominantly the larger muscles,” says Vedant Vaksha, MD, a spine surgeon with Complete Orthopedics in Long Island, New York. “It helps in stretching and strengthening muscles of the forearm, arm, neck and back, hips, thighs, and legs.” But it can also deliver some other lesser known benefits, and ones you may not notice when looking in the mirror. Here are seven health benefits associated with Pilates."

These are important questions to ask, because proper fuel can make a huge difference in your energy level, mood, and results — and thus greatly influence how likely you are to work out again.The world of pre- and post-workout nutrition is confusing, and there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. One thing you should know, however, is that the food you put in your body before, during, and after your sweat session can definitely affect how you feel and whether or not you meet your workout goals.
