High-quality clinical trials of ketogenic diets will be needed to assess important questions about their long-term effects and full potential in clinical medicine”"

The study concluded that relative food prices vary systematically across countries and partially explain international differences in the prevalences of undernutrition and overweight adults. Future research should focus on how to alter relative prices to achieve better dietary and nutrition outcomes. This article received a lot of international attention and was mentioned in 27 news outlets. Two stories reporting on this research are from Medical Xpress and Business Standard."

Findings indicate that the amount of vitamin K contents in dairy products is high and proportional to the fat content of the product."

It finds that while demand for organic products is on the rise, farmers still face challenges using and transitioning to organic practices. Published every five years, NORA seeks to identify key challenges facing organic farmers. The report uses survey data to highlight research areas and recommendations that directly address farmer-identified needs. This year’s report draws on responses from over 1,100 certified organic farmers and 71 transitioning-to-organic farmers. The NORA report finds that in 2020, organic food sales experienced a 12 percent increase from 2019, exceeding US$56 billion."

            "description": "When inflation goes up, economists often talk about the economy being “hot.” Right now, it’s hot enough to leave grill marks. Climate change, the invasion of Ukraine, and the continued impact of COVID-19 all have driven food inflation to a rate that is higher than any time over the past generation. And change is not on the menu, at least not in the near-term, especially for hamburgers as we head into summer grilling season. The ongoing drought in the Western U.S.—which has been exacerbated by climate change—is now leading cattle producers to shrink their herds in the face of higher costs for animal feed. That means fewer cows in the next year or two, and thus, less beef on the market."
